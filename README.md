## General Information

- **Background**: BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, experienced a revenue decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. To rebound, they aim to understand the factors driving the demand for shared bikes. This analysis will help them create a data-driven business strategy to meet future demand.

- **Business Problem**: The primary goal is to identify the variables influencing bike demand and quantify their impact. By modeling the demand dynamics, BoomBikes can prepare for post-pandemic recovery and gain a competitive edge in the market.

- **Dataset Used**: The dataset includes daily bike demand across the American market, capturing variables like weather conditions, seasonal trends, and user types (casual and registered). The dependent variable is `cnt`, representing the total number of rentals.


## Conclusions

1. **Key Factors Influencing Demand**:
   - Temperature positively correlates with demand.
   - Demand increased from 2018 to 2019.
   - Unfavorable weather reduces demand.

2. **Seasonal and Categorical Effects**:
   - Demand peaks in summer and spring, lowest in winter.
   - Patterns in variables like season and weather influence demand.

3. **Model Performance**:
   - Regression model achieves an R-squared of ~0.80 on the test set.
   - Residual analysis confirms linear regression assumptions.

4. **Business Insights**:
   - Warmer weather drives higher demand; ensure bike availability in peak seasons.
   - Target marketing campaigns during favorable weather for maximum rentals.
