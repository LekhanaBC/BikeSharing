->General Information

•	Background: BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, experienced a revenue decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. To rebound, they aim to understand the factors driving the demand for shared bikes. This analysis will help them create a data-driven business strategy to meet future demand.

•	Business Problem: The primary goal is to identify the variables influencing bike demand and quantify their impact. By modeling the demand dynamics, BoomBikes can prepare for post-pandemic recovery and gain a competitive edge in the market.

•	Dataset Used: The dataset includes daily bike demand across the American market, capturing variables like weather conditions, seasonal trends, and user types (casual and registered). The dependent variable is cnt, representing the total number of rentals.

->Conclusions:

1.	Key Features Impacting Demand:
o	Temperature (positive correlation with demand).
o	Year (increase in demand from 2018 to 2019).
o	Weather conditions (less demand during unfavorable weather).

3.	Categorical Variables:
o	Variables like season and weathersit show clear patterns influencing demand.
o	Demand is highest in summer and spring and lowest in winter.

5.	Model Performance:
o	The final regression model explains a significant portion of the variance in bike demand, with an R-squared of ~0.80 on the test set.
o	Residual analysis confirms the model satisfies linear regression assumptions.

7.	Business Insight:
o	Bike demand increases in warmer weather, highlighting the need to ensure bike availability in peak seasons.
o	Marketing campaigns should target favorable weather periods to maximize rentals.
